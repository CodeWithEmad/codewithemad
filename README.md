### Hey ðŸ‘‹

I'm Emad, a senior software engineer at [troweb](https://troweb.com), working on AI solutions for businesses.
I'm also a core contributor to the [Open edX](https://github.com/openedx) project, collaborating with a global community to enhance learning experiences.
In my spare time, I'm working on [Iranian GitHub](https://github.com/iranian-github), an organization focused on empowering Iranian developers and the society.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently based in Iran and stuck in the middle of Iran-Israel conflict, I don't have the stable network connection to review pull requests and issues. Kindly be patient and I'll get to them as soon as possible.

You can explore my work through:
